# Project agent memory

This file is the project's committed home for project-intrinsic agent knowledge: build, test, release, architecture, and sharp-edge notes that should travel with the code.

- Add durable project-specific notes here as they are discovered through real work.

## Memory retain (ADR-026)

- All production retains go through `MemoryRouter.retain(MemoryEventType, …)`; routing is `EVENT_WRITE_MAP` in `advoi/memory/write_targets.py`.
- Do not call `retain_strategic` / `aretain` outside `advoi/memory/{router,hindsight,bridge_server}.py` (plus Hermes bridge scripts).
- Do not call `retain_operational_unified` from outside `advoi/memory/` — use the router with a mapped event (e.g. `WORKFLOW_EVOLUTION`, `SQUAD_LESSON`).
- Never put fleet backlog text into Hindsight / strategic event types. Fleet-scout tick summaries are operational (`SQUAD_LESSON`) only.
- Guard: `tests/test_memory_retain_audit.py`. Latest inventory: `data/feedback-evidence/advoi-memory-retain-audit-01/audit.md`.
- Brief Curator Hindsight seed (`scripts/seed-advoi-briefs.sh`) is a known map tension (decision_brief → Postgres in map); owned by brief-triple-path work, not retain audit.
