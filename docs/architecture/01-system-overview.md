# System overview

ADVoi is a voice-first executive operating layer over an existing portfolio stack (Hermes, FirstMate fleet, Aether). It is **not** a replacement for those systems; it routes attention, surfaces briefs, and speaks results.

> **Doc sync:** Runtime ships **6 agents / 6 frames** and built Aether, Guardian, Squads, and Ingestion verticals. This overview was reconciled with code on branch `fm/advoi-arch-doc-sync-01` (closes arch review gap row *Routing/Decision **Stale***; unblocks M9.4 / GAP-012). Companion: [ARCHITECTURE-DATA-MEMORY-REVIEW.md](../reviews/ARCHITECTURE-DATA-MEMORY-REVIEW.md).

## Design principles

1. **Thin voice layer** — LiveKit + Pipecat handle transport; business logic stays in routing, memory, and decision modules.
2. **Confirmation harness** — High-stakes frames (e.g. deep review) require explicit confirmation before side effects (Guardian).
3. **Ontology-first** (target) — Named frames, agents, and memory write targets; full ontology engine not built yet.
4. **Production-oriented** — Health checks, env-driven config, Docker services, smoke scripts from day one.

## Module map

### Verticals (domain)

| Module | Path | Status |
|--------|------|--------|
| Voice | `advoi/voice/` | **Built** — Pipecat agent, tokens, frame dispatch, memory hooks |
| Decision | `advoi/decision/` | **Built** — Frame catalog (**6 frames**, Options A–F) |
| Memory | `advoi/memory/` | **Built** — Router, Hindsight bridge, Postgres, Redis, review queue |
| Routing | `advoi/routing/` | **Built** — 6 agents, frame runner, daemons, supervisor, run-six |
| API | `advoi/api/` | **Built** — FastAPI HTTP surface |
| LLM | `advoi/llm/` | **Built** — OpenRouter-first credentials |
| Aether | `advoi/aether/` | **Built** — gate, portfolio, architect, lifecycle, service facade |
| Guardian | `advoi/guardian/` | **Built** — confirmation harness, recovery, notifications, auto-restart |
| Squads | `advoi/squads/` | **Built** — registry, dispatch, run-six platform orchestration |
| Fleet | `advoi/fleet/` | **Built** — bridge, trigger, session (when present) |

### Horizontals (cross-cutting)

| Module | Path | Status |
|--------|------|--------|
| Ingestion | `advoi/ingestion/` | **Built** (MVP) — upload, parse, route, store, optional FirstMate dispatch |
| Reporting | `advoi/reporting/` | Stub |
| Ontology | `advoi/ontology/` | Stub |
| Observability | `advoi/observability/` | Partial — system graph; OTel collector in compose (profile `observability`) |

### Web client

| Path | Status |
|------|--------|
| `web/` | **Built** — Next.js 15 PWA; home `/` = onboarding + briefs surface + `VoiceSession` (LiveKit, 6 frames, chips) |
| `web/components/PwaHomeBriefsSurface.tsx` | **Built** — open briefs + review queue cards (`GET /api/briefs`, `GET /api/review-queue`) |
| `web/voice-interface/` | **Built** — Kokoro + Parakeet client loop at `/voice-local` |

## High-level diagram

Deployment/component view. **Control-plane logic** (voice, ingest, fleet bridge, memory retain, Aether gate): [08-system-logic-flows.md](08-system-logic-flows.md).

Six specialist agent daemons (one per decision frame), plus API, voice, and memory bridge:

Daemon → agent id mapping (compose `app` profile):

| Compose service | Agent id | Frame id |
|-----------------|----------|----------|
| `advoi-agent-fleet` | `fleet-scout` | `fleet_status` |
| `advoi-agent-briefs` | `brief-curator` | `open_briefs` |
| `advoi-agent-review` | `review-queue` | `queue_deep_review` |
| `advoi-agent-systems` | `systems-pulse` | `systems_pulse` |
| `advoi-agent-memory` | `memory-scout` | `memory_health` |
| `advoi-agent-guardian` | `guardian-sentinel` | `guardian_status` |

## What is explicitly out of scope (today)

- Full free-speech NLU (keyword/intent routing exists; not full semantic NLU)
- Full ontology governance engine (`advoi/ontology/` still stub)
- Multi-tenant SaaS / production multi-user personalization
- Client-side Kokoro/Parakeet loop (designed, not merged)
- Reporting / BI engine on memory events
