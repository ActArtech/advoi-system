# ADVoi

Voice-first personal AI operating system.

## Architecture

ADVoi is organized as **verticals** (domain capabilities) and **horizontals** (cross-cutting services).

### Verticals

| Module | Role |
|--------|------|
| `voice/` | LiveKit transport + Pipecat pipeline (thin wrapper) |
| `aether/` | Portfolio manager + venture architect |
| `guardian/` | Security, error detection, recovery (Sentinel) |
| `squads/` | Execution crews (FirstMate integration) |
| `decision/` | Decision frames, briefs, optionality |
| `memory/` | Hybrid memory (strategic / operational / ephemeral) |

### Horizontals

| Module | Role |
|--------|------|
| `ingestion/` | Large text/document processing engine |
| `reporting/` | Communication & stakeholder reports |
| `routing/` | Intent classification, model routing, token management |
| `ontology/` | Strategy stack definitions |
| `observability/` | Logs, metrics, SigNoz integration |

## VPS deploy (Aether standard)

See **[docs/VPS-SETUP.md](docs/VPS-SETUP.md)** for the three-tier www flow:

| Tier | Path | URL |
|------|------|-----|
| Develop | `/data/projects/advoi` (`develop`) | — |
| Staging | `/var/www/advoi/staging` | https://advoi-staging.keyteller.com |
| Live | `/var/www/advoi/live` | https://advoi.keyteller.com |

Promote: `bash scripts/www/promote-to-staging.sh` (or host `/var/www/advoi/promote-to-staging.sh`) · smoke: `curl https://advoi-staging.keyteller.com/api/health`

`/opt/advoi` is the **legacy** single-path stack (deprecating until cutover). www-tier scripts: **[scripts/www/README.md](scripts/www/README.md)** · overlay `compose.www.yml`.

Memory: **[docs/MEMORY-STACK.md](docs/MEMORY-STACK.md)** — start Hindsight via Hermes; Letta optional v0.2.

Hermes spend: **[docs/HERMES-COST-OPTIMIZATION.md](docs/HERMES-COST-OPTIMIZATION.md)** — cost directive before scaling voice/memory.

## Quick Start (local)

```bash
cp deploy/.env.staging.example deploy/.env
docker compose up -d
uv sync
uv run python -c "from advoi.memory import MemoryRouter; print('memory OK')"
```

## Principles

- **Thin voice layer** — transport only; intelligence lives in verticals/horizontals.
- **Confirmation harness** — consequential actions require explicit verbal confirmation.
- **Ontology-first** — named relationships, events, and bounded contexts drive consistency.
- **Production-oriented** — structured logging, health checks, env-driven config from day one.
